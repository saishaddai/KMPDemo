# Kotlin Multiplatform Application: My First Attempt
=====================================================

## Introduction
This project is my first attempt at creating a Kotlin Multiplatform application. The goal is to explore the capabilities of Kotlin Multiplatform and create a simple application that runs on multiple platforms, including Android, iOS, and Desktop.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

* `common`: This module contains the shared Kotlin code that will be used across all platforms.
* `android`: This module contains the Android-specific implementation of the application.
* `ios`: This module contains the iOS-specific implementation of the application.
* `desktop`: This module contains the Desktop-specific implementation of the application.

## Features
* Shared business logic across all platforms using Kotlin Multiplatform
* Android implementation using Android SDK
* iOS implementation using iOS SDK
* Desktop implementation using Kotlin/JVM

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

* Java 17 or higher
* Kotlin 1.7.10 or higher
* Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA with Kotlin Multiplatform plugin
* Xcode for iOS development
* Gradle or Maven for building the project

### Building and Running the Project

1. Clone the repository and open it in Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Make sure to select the correct SDK and JDK versions.
3. Build the project using Gradle or Maven.
4. Run the application on the desired platform (Android, iOS, or Desktop).

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while building or running the project, please check the following:

* Ensure that the correct SDK and JDK versions are selected.
* Check the build configuration and dependencies.
* Review the project structure and module settings.
